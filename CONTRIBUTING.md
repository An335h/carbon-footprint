# üëê Contributing

So you want to contribute? Great! Please read the following instructions to avoid any confusion. Working with many people on a single project can be a challenge, it can very painfull for both maintainers and contributors, so we need to set some guidelines to make it smooth.

NB : These guidelines are and will always be up for discussion. Just open a ticket if anything could be improved!

We love your input, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing improvement / new features
- Becoming a maintainer

### Pull Requests

We welcome pull requests to change to the codebase.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Make your pull request

## Code Quality

Please try to do the following :

- Every new piece of code requires tests. 
- Run `yarn lint` to make sure that your code passes linting. 
- Naming and folder structure is _really_ important. Have a look to the current code and see how it's done üòâ
- Do not reinvent the wheel : if you want to add a library like lodash instead of ramda, open a ticket first so we can discuss it.
